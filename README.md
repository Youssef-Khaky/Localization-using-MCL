#Localization Project
This project is used as an intro to localization. I used it to explore some packages in the ros navigation stack, namely the move base package and the AMCL package.  


Please open "introduction-localization.pdf" for the full report on what I learnt.

##Achievemnt
Sent a target pose to the robot and using the move base package it generated and executed a plan.  
The AMCL package localized the robot.  
I explore many of the parameters that can be tuned in the AMCL and the move base package.
